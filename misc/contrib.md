## How to Contribute
You can contibute by opening a `pr` or by creating a github `issue`.
if I close your pr or issue, that either means that I've merged/implemented it, or 
I think it's too stupid. 
<br>
these rules are loose approximations of what I want to happen, there are obviously
edge cases that I haven't really taken into consideration when writing `contrib.md`.

## Instructions
<li>Don't open useless pr's | don't open a pr that just points out a bunch of spelling erorrs or something like that. It needs to be somethign useful that you need to add</li>
<li>non of your pr's can conflict with unit testing, unless you're adding testing for a feature that you added</li>
